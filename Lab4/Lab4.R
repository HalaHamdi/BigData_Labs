# 3.Load the transactions in the file AssociationRules.csv using the function  read.transactions. 
# Make sure you donâ€™t include the header line in the dataset. 
# The file is in the same folder as the R script.

# 7. Generate the association rules from the transactions using the apriori algorithm. Set 
# the minimum support = 0.01, minimum confidence = 0.5, minimum cardinality 
# (number of items in the rule) = 2. Use the function apriori

# 8.Now, sort the generated rules by support. Search the function sort found in the 
# arules package. Show only the first 6 rules

# 9. Sort the generated rules by confidence. Show only the first 6 rules
inspect(sort(rules, by = "confidence", decreasing = TRUE)[1:6])

# 10. Sort the generated rules by lift. Show only the first 6 rules.

# 11.  Plot the generated rules with support as x-axis, confidence as y-axis and lift as 
# shading. Use the function plot in arules package.

# 12. Based on (8-11), Can you tell now what are the most interesting rules that are really 
# useful and provide a real business value and an insight to the concerned corporate?
